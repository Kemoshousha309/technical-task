# Technical Task

## Getting Started

- Clone source code on your machine
- Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`
- Start the dev server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`  or you can build the project

## Overview

This is a technical task which has two main sub-tasks:

- Categories Form: This is a form that shows some product Properties and then shows the values the user chooses.
- Static Page: It's a simple static page with no interactivity just for show purposes.

### Note
  
> When you run the app and choose one of the two sub-tasks you have to use url directly to get back and choose the other task as there is no navigation to take you back.
